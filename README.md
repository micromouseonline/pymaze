# pymaze
A workspace for testing Python maze implementations for micromouse

 - Working towards a common Maze API that everyone can use to define common operations
 - Seeking small, fast implementations for use with MicroPython
 - Code also needs to run on PC for testing

### Files

`maze_support.py` is the place to put global maze-related constants 

Implementtions can each live in their own file. These files should be executable and probably perform some self-testing.

### TODO

- Clean up maze_support.py
- document a basic, minimal API
- write some tests for `maze_tests.py`
